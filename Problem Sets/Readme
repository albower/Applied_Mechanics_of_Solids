#Example Problems in Mechanics of Solids (A.F. Bower)

The best way to learn the physical sciences and mathematics is to dive in and start solving problems by yourself.   The hard part is knowing what problems to solve.   With this in mind, ‘Example Problems in Mechanics of Solids’ offers a large number of exercises that are designed to help students and practicing engineers to learn how to predict stresses and deformation in solids. The problems may also be useful for instructors who are looking for worked examples to use in lectures or assignments.

The book is intended to be used as a companion volume to  A.F. Bower’s “Applied Mechanics of Solids,” 2nd ed. CRC press, Boca Raton FL (2026).   The chapter headings and sub-sections are identical in both books, and every topic covered in the main text has a set of relevant exercises.   Where appropriate, the example problems also reference the relevant sections of Applied Mechanics of Solids.

A solution manual - A.F. Bower’s “Solved Problems in Mechanics of Solids,” CRC press, Boca Raton FL (2026) - is in press. 

There are a total of 528 problems.   The problems in each section are progressive: like piano etudes, the first few are usually deceptively easy, but the last ones can be very challenging.  They cover the following topics:
•	The Appendix contains a set of review problems covering vectors and matrices; tensors; index notation, and polar coordinates.  Working through a few of these problems would be a good starting point for a self-study course.
•	Chapter 1 contains a few general questions on applications of solid mechanics.
•	Chapter 2 has a large number of problems covering kinematics; stress measures; and field equations.
•	The problems in Chapter 3 focus on constitutive laws.
•	Chapter 4 has a set of boundary value problems for solids with a simple geometry and an elastic constitutive law, which can be solved analytically.
•	The problems in Chapter 5 are concerned with applications of the theory of linear elasticity;
•	Chapter 6 has problems that illustrate solutions to boundary value problems and limit theorems for plastically deforming solids
•	Chapter 7 has a set of introductory problems related to finite element analysis, and includes a set of tutorial exercises that are designed to be solved using the ‘learning edition’ of the commercial finite element code ABAQUS®.   This code can be downloaded at no cost from the third-party website https://www.3ds.com/edu/education/students/solutions/abaqus-le. 
•	The problems in Chapter 8 cover the detailed implementation of the finite element method, and include examples that involved finite element coding in MATLAB®.
•	Chapter 9 has problems related to modeling failure in solids, and the theory of fracture mechanics.
•	Chapter 10 covers the theory of rods, plates and shells.
